    <p>&amp;quot;The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.&amp;quot; - Eleanor Roosevelt </p>

    <a href="/posts/hedonism/">Hedonism</a>
    <p>&amp;quot;To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible... A new Hedonism, that is what our century wants.&amp;quot;</p>

    <p>&amp;quot;If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment&amp;quot; — Marcus Aurelius</p>
